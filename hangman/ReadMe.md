This is a simple Hangman game implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

4. If you guess a correct letter, it will be revealed in the word display.
5. If you guess an incorrect letter, a part of the hangman will be drawn.
6. Keep guessing letters until you either correctly guess the word or run out of attempts.

## Features
